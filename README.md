# Daily Code Challenges



- All challenges have one or more tests that run when the `run-tests-by-opening-in-browser.html` file is opened in the browser. 

- By default, Jasmine (the testing framework) will run the tests in random order. To prevent this, click on the **Options** button on the near the top-right of the page and uncheck the _run tests in random order_ checkbox.

- Solve the challenges by writing functions in the `challenges.js` file only.  **DO NOT MODIFY ANY OTHER FILE.**

- Each code challenge requires writing a **single function** to solve.
